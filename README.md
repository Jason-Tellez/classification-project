# Classification Project

_________________

## Planning
### Objectives

- Document code, data-pipeline processes, findings, and key takeaways.
- Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make process repeateable.
- Construct a model to predict customer churn using classification techniques.
- Deliver a brief presentation with walkthrough using your Jupyter Notebook; adjust presentation to target audience (Codeup Data Science team).
- Answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.


### Goals

- Find drivers for customer churn at Telco.
- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
- Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report
